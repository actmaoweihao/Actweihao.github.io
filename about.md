### brief introduction
I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the School of Science of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (expected graduation year 2025).
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Yaodong Yang at the Institute for AI, Peking University.My current research interests mainly focus on scalable oversight and offline safe RL.

### Experiences
**Project Title**: Statistical Measurement of the Modernization of China's Manufacturing Industry Supply Chain (First Author) March 2023 - May 2023
**Project Research**: The research aims to develop a new evaluation index system to measure the modernization level of China's manufacturing industry supply chain based on the eight major features that it should possess, taking into account the requirements of China's modernization. The project will use the Entropy Weight-TOPSIS method to carry out statistical measurement of the modernization level of the manufacturing industrial supply chain in different provinces (regions, cities) of China. Additionally, the project will analyze the spatiotemporal evolution trend of the modernization index of the manufacturing industry supply chain by using the Kernel Density Estimation method.
**Main Work**: To collect and analyze data on the modernization level of the manufacturing industry supply chain in China and analyze the trends. The project will also use statistical methods to carry out measurement of industrial chain modernization and the application of modern IT and communication technologies.
**Main Results**: Awarded Second Prize in the Undergraduate Group of 2023 National University Student Statistical Modeling Competition in Beijing. The project team conducted a comprehensive analysis and found that the modernization level of the manufacturing industry supply chain in China is distributed in three parts: East> Central> West and South> Central> North.
 
**Project Title**: Summer Research and Study Exchange Program at the National University of Singapore (score: A/A+) (First Author) July 2023 - August 2023
**Project Research**: The project aims to develop a predictive model for second-hand housing prices in Beijing through appropriate feature engineering and analysis of second-hand housing price data.
**Main Work**: To develop and train the predictive model using TensorFlow deep learning frameworks after obtaining the data and processing it. The project will also involve the collection of second-hand housing information and price data from the Woaiwojia website.
**Main Results**: The team developed a predictive model for second-hand housing prices in Beijing and visualized the data.

**Project Title**: Generate Rather Than Annotate: Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering Construction via ChatGPT《DASFAA》(In submission), CCF B, Third Author March 2023 - September 2023
**Project Research**: The project aims to construct a model that uses ChatGPT to generate zero-shot knowledge graph question-answering (KGQA ) by adopting a three-stage generation-retrieval process. This model will extract knowledge from unmarked text corpus to solve problems and output appropriate answers. 
**Main Work**: The project team performed the NER experiment code writing, construction of the APD dataset, as well as the drawing and writing portions of the paper.
**Main Results**: The project team developed the APD agricultural dataset and the GenRetrieve model for natural language processing tasks.
