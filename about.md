I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the School of Science of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (expected graduation year 2025).
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Yaodong Yang at the Institute for AI, Peking University.My current research interests mainly focus on scalable oversight and offline safe RL.
